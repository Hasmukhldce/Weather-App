Design and developed a Weather Application that fetches current weather data based on selected cities from API. 
Created front-end code in HTML, CSS and JS to enable data retrieval as JSON Object and displayed results on web pages by fetching API data using async and express-hbs. 
Used media queries to develop responsive web app and tested front-end code in multiple browsers to ensure cross- browser compatibility.
